## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
vehicle = read.csv("/Users/anjalisinha/Documents/MTech KE/Sem 1/DMMM/Day8/vehicle_safety_NASS2010_2000_2012.csv", header=T, na.strings=c("","NA"))
```

## Install VIM Package
```{r}
install.packages("VIM")
library(VIM)
```


## Study the data
```{r}
summary(vehicle)
data(vehicle)
str(vehicle)
```


## kNN Imputation
```{r}
vehicle2 <- kNN(vehicle)
```


## Saving the data.frame with imputed values
```{r}
write.csv(vehicle2, file = "/Users/anjalisinha/Documents/MTech KE/Sem 1/DMMM/Day8/knn_impute_vehicle_safety_NASS2010_2000_2012.csv")
```
